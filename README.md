# Oystercard_challenge # 

*Makers Academy - Week 2 Challenge* 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

##  ðŸš‰ **Brief:**
The project consists of a simulation of the TfL Oyster card system and I have recently redone the vast majority of it (steps 1-15), to stretch my skills in **Ruby**, **TDD** and **Object-Oriented Design**.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ðŸš‰ **User Stories** that support the program:
```
In order to use public transport,
As a customer,
I want money on my card.
```

```
In order to keep using public transport,
As a customer,
I want to add money to my card.
```

```
In order to protect my money,
As a customer,
I don't want to put too much money on my card.
```

```
In order to pay for my journey,
As a customer,
I need my fare deducted from my card.
```

```
In order to get through the barriers,
As a customer,
I need to touch in and out.
```

```
In order to pay for my journey,
As a customer,
I need to have the minimum amount for a single journey.
```

```
In order to pay for my journey,
As a customer,
I need to pay for my journey when it's complete.
```

```
In order to pay for my journey,
As a customer,
I need to know where I've travelled from.
```

```
In order to know where I have been,
As a customer,
I want to see to all my previous trips.
```

```
In order to know how far I have travelled,
As a customer,
I want to know what zone a station is in.
```

```
In order to be charged correctly,
As a customer,
I need a penalty charge deducted if I fail to touch in or out.
```

```
In order to be charged the correct amount,
As a customer,
I need to have the correct fare calculated.
```
